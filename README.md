# DisasterDao

This project is a frontend mockup for DisasterDao — a concept for a decentralized platform that helps track disasters and manage aid distribution in a transparent way using blockchain.

## Project Overview

The goal of this version is to visually present and explain how DisasterDao would function, even though it doesn’t currently include blockchain integration. It serves as a prototype to demonstrate the user interface and flow of the platform.

## Features

- Responsive and clean user interface built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Pages and sections that simulate:
  - Real-time disaster tracking
  - Aid donation and distribution process
  - Governance features like voting and proposals (visually represented)

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- GitHub for version control

## Note

This is a frontend-only mockup meant for presentation and design purposes. It does not yet connect to any smart contract or Ethereum backend. The blockchain functionality will be added in a future version.

## About This Project

This project was created as part of a learning initiative and to demonstrate my frontend development skills. I worked on the entire frontend and designed it to explain our DAO concept clearly during presentations and hackathons.

Feel free to use or build upon this structure if you're planning to add backend or Web3 integration later.
